                     <p>Technology has affected the leagl profession in so many ways that it has become so a struggle to keep up with. Technology has enabled the law profession to automate processes and operate more like the business sector.</p>

                     <p>In Priscilla&#8217;s session she will explore this relationship even more closely and how with knowldege of her internship at Hilton Top Solicitors, emphasize these budding areas of LawTech.</p>

Before long we’ll be including an image within the <div> element, alongside the unordered list; therefore we created a <div> element as opposed to applying these styles directly to the <ul> element.-->

       			N.B: Remove the speaker class from the section of the last speaker in order to prevent applying its css properties which basically creates margins before the footer element. Leaving it for now because I may still add other speakers to the list -->

       				<h5>International Law</h5>

       				<p>Honestly, I dont know where all my international law knowledge has gone in this past year but I'll definetely include something on this page. However, for now, I will just note this down here to fill up the space till I eventually find somewhing noteworthy to occupy the vaccum.</p>

       				<p>Also, I must note that at the point of writing this I was already seriously exhausted hence the lack of content. This new paragraph is by all means to add more words to fill up the space. This journey has been more difficult than I ever envisaged but quite interesting too.</p>

       				<h5>About Jane</h5>
       				<p> Jane is just Jane because it is so weird trying to profile myself to be very honest. I still wonder how people do it effectively well when they write out their profile and I lack the requisite energy to write about myself right now. This yet is another successful attempt at filling up the spaces for now.</p>
